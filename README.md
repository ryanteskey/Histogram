	Attach a file histogram_lastname.rb as an attachment to the assignment in Canvas
	Subject line: CIS 282, Name, Histogram Assignment

To do:
	Design and implement an application that creates a histogram that allows you to
    visually inspect the frequency distribution of a set of values.  The program
    should generate 200 random integers in the range 1 through 100 (inclusive);
    then produce a chart similar to the one below that indicates how many values
    fell in the range 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and so on. Print one asterisk for each value
    entered.

		01 – 10		|  *******
